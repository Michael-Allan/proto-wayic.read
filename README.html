<h1 lang='en-CA'>wayic.read - Way declarations that are readable on the web</h1>
                         <!-- Changing? sync'd → readable.* -->
<p lang='en-CA'>
    Here is a basic, web-oriented presentation transformer for
    <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/cast/way_declaration_document'>way declaration documents</a>.

    When a <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/cast/waycast'>waycast</a> is viewed in a web browser,
    wayic.read modifies the structure and styling of the documents it contains,
    making their texts easier to read and their links with other documents easier to navigate.

    It does what is needed in order to present a complete, easily readable view
    of the way declaration as a whole.  It aims for a conservative presentation,
    true to the declaration’s formal source in the context of its native waycast.
    <!-- Informed by the waycast structure, affording it maximal exposure and effect.
